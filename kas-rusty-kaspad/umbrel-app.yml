description: |
  Rusty Kaspad is a Rust implementation of a Kaspa full node. This node software 
  provides essential Kaspa network services including peer-to-peer networking and 
  RPC functionality. 
  
  Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with instant
  transaction confirmation through blockDAG technology.

  The very heart of Kaspa is the public nodes. Please consider making your node public
  by forwarding TCP port 16111 on your firewall to your Umbrel node IP address to support the network.

  This package uses the Docker container maintained by supertypo
  (https://hub.docker.com/r/supertypo/rusty-kaspad), based on Rusty Kaspa (https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa).
